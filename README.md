# 🌟 My Go Tutorial Exercises Repo 📚

Welcome to my Go tutorial exercises repository! This repository contains the code I wrote while following the tutorial [Create a Go Module](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module).

## 📂 Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

### 1. 🌍 Hello

This folder contains the code for the "Hello, World!" exercise. It demonstrates the basic structure of a Go program and how to build and run it.

To build the program, navigate to the `hello` folder and run the following command:

```shell
go build
```

To run the program, use the following command:

```shell
./hello
```

Feel free to modify the names in the hello.go file and see how it affects the program's output.

### 2. 👋 Greetings

The greetings folder includes code for the "Greetings" exercise. It introduces the concept of packages, importing, and writing tests in Go.

To run the tests for the greetings package, navigate to the greetings folder and run the following command:

```shell
go test
```

Explore the code and tests to learn more about how the greetings package works.
